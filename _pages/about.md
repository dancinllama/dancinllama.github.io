## About Dancinllama
I am  a Salesforce Architect / Developer with over a decades worth of experience in Salesforce.  I've spent all 10 years in a consulting role.  With my first "gig" at EDL Consulting, we implemented and provided fixes for CloudCraze, or what is now Salesforce B2B Commerce. 

At both EDL Consulting and Demand Chain, I've worked across most Salesforce products with a variety of clients and products, including a storefront for selling hi-fidelity FLAC files for Neil Young's "Pono player", another project that was the precursor to community cloud, reporting integrations for a well known web conferencing platform, integrating Salesforce with an EHR for a well known Mental Health institution, and more.

In addition to work duties, I co-lead the Twin Cities Salesforce Developer Group https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/twin-cities-mn-developers-group/, and am actively involved in the Salesforce community.  I was elected as a Salesforce MVP in Spring of 2013, and have been inducted into the Salesforce MVP Hall of Fame (2013 - 2019)

### Why dancinLlama?
I often get asked why I chose dancinllama as a nickname.  Well it's a lot less cool than it sounds!  I actually wasn't a huge fan of llamas when I picked the name out many moons ago.  Much to my GPA's downfall, I played a lot of video games in college, including Quake III Team Arena and Return to Castle Wolfenstein.  My roommate played with a group as well, and in that group there was someone named "dancing cow".  I thought the name was great.  So when I happened to join a Day of Defeat group called the "Amazing Llama Nation", I borrowed the dancing cow idea and wa-la, dancing llama (or dancinLlama for short) was born.
