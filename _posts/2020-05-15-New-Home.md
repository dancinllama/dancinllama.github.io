I've moved! I've habitually had many blogs over the years, including blogger, my company('s) blogs, and even guest writing for others.   I feel it's time to consolidate and start fresh.  Since I spend quite a bit of time on github, creating, contributing to, and perusing repositories on here, what better place to move my blog than Github Pages.

On this blog, I hope you'll find useful content around:
- Salesforce Development
- Salesforce Deployments
- Salesforce integrations
- Maybe a bit of Node and Heroku
- And who knows what else.


Cheers, - James / @dancinLlama
