I created a polling adapter in my BPEL process.  Once I threw it on the server, it caused the Oracle XE (10.1.3?) database to crash.  After the database crashed, I could not view the BPEL console nor execute any commands on the database through SQL Developer.  The error I received was 'ORA-12519'.

What happens is that the XE database by default only allows a small number of connections.  BPEL consumes those connections rather quickly. If you encounter this problem, restart the XE database:
- Perform the following SQL as SYS user: ALTER SYSTEM SET PROCESSES=150 SCOPE=SPFILE
- Restart the database
- Restart BPEL / SOA
