Trailhead has been my goto tool for learning about new Salesforce functionality and brushing up on my existing Salesforce skills for over a year now.  There are a plethora (I love being able to sneak in a good use of the word plethora) of trails and modules for both admins and developers alike.

One thing that has been missing though are soft skills related modules.  Soft skills are something that we all can benefit from.  Whether you're a developer, administrator, manager, president of a company.  No matter your role, there's always room for refining those soft skills.

The Salesforce Cultivate Equality at Work Trail offers advice for improving on those soft skills and includes modules for promoting workplace equality.  Another trail that offers soft skills is the "Manage the Salesforce Way" trail which promotes exploring and improving your listening and managerial soft skills.

In addition to the soft skills above, you'll also want to check out the new trail for Navigating the Salesforce advantage.  This trail contains modules / badges that explain the various factors that sets Salesforce apart from other CRM and software eco systems. (Hint: my favorite factor is the amazing community that makes the Salesforce ecosystem thrive)

So, what are you waiting for? Head over to http://trailhead.salesforce.com today and start earning one of the many badges!
