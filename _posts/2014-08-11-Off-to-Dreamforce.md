Dreamforce is the the most important conference for Salesforce developers.  It's a pilgrimage that a Salesforce Developer must make at least once in their careers.  Although the cost is high, whether it's through registration, lodging, or billable hours as a Consultant, the benefits are enormous.

For one, Dreamforce offers an opportunity to network with your peers and top developers within the Salesforce community.  Chances are the moment you step foot out of your hotel on Monday morning, you will find someone you recognize.  Whether that person is a colleague, Salesforce employee, AE, or an MVP, who knows.  Don't be afraid to walk up and introduce yourself.

It's going to be a long day.  On your way to Moscone West, where all the techies hang out, stop by Starbucks and grab your latte.   It's always fun to see how they mispronounce your name on your cup.  Last year, they somehow turned "James" into "Juarez". Check out the Mini Hacks area and just walk around and explore for a bit.  It's overwhelming.

After you get settled in a bit, go check out some sessions.  The best and most informative sessions I attended were on the first day at Dreamforce last year.  I picked up some excellent pointers, and I'm sure you will too.

As the week progresses, don't be afraid to check out other areas outside Moscone West.  Head to the declarative sessions and pick up declarative tips from the formula geniuses like SteveMo or from the Success Community Zone where the MVPs hang out and answer any questions you may have.

As you soak everything in, make sure you take moments to reflect on your week.  Bring your ipads, notebooks, business cards, and document all you have learned over the long week.  In fact, here is my list of must haves for your Dreamforce trip.

- A notebook or an iPad for taking notes
- Your most recent business cards for networking
- Comfortable shoes.  You'll be walking a lot.  I racked up 35,000 fitbit steps on the first day last year.
- Precut moleskin pads.  You will get blisters.  Be prepared.  The precut pads are best, otherwise you will need to cut the moleskin, which isn't an easy venture.
- Extra space in your luggage for freebies such as books from the Developer Zone, swag from the Expo, or prizes you may win.  Although, you might have trouble finding room for a Mustang or Tesla.
- Umbrella.  In general, be prepared for the weather.  Last year it rained a bit, but having an Umbrella helped getting from point A to point B.
- A mobile battery pack for your smart phone.  If you're anything like me, your phone will drain quickly.  Here's a battery pack that works well for my iPhone: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BZD6QCW
- A camera.  I'm a photography fan, so traveling without my Nikon is not an option.  You'll find lots of photographic opportunities around town or in the various Dreamforce venues.  Fisherman's Wharf is a short walk down Market Street.  Or you may be lucky enough to catch a ride from a Marine Biologist down to the Golden Gate bridge, who knows!
- Maybe you're a Google Glass user or a Fitbit fanatic or a Pebble Pedestrian.  Either way, bring your wearables along to Dreamforce for an enhanced experience.
- Bring a plan.  Odds are your plan will change during the conference.  However, having a general idea of what you want to get out of Dreamforce goes a long way.
